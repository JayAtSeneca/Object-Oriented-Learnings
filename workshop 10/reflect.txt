// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned and implemented new concept of polymorphism which is known as templates. First started with the examples given in the start of the where I first checked all the additional three given modules of the displayable, employee, student, car, and the collection template. After  that, one example is also given in the instructions which is useful in implementing the temp’s module. After that I started implementing the templates module where I created the first select function which returns the collection array of the element only for those collected elements which matches which the object which is passed by reference in the arguments. As I told earlier, there are three arguments passed in the select function the first one the collection of the array, the second is the size of the array and the third one the object reference of the array which is to be collected and for the select template to work there are three required function which is needed is the comparison operator(==), assignment operator, copy constructor and the index operator is required for the function to work properly. Another function which I implement is the printing the collection function which has two arguments one is the constant collection object passed by the reference and another one is the character string which shows the title of the object reference this is the void function and does not return anything and the required function for the print collection function to work is the extraction operator .
